### Overall Plan for SLogo

+ Parsing will take place in the Interpreter class, which will accept **String inputs** as keys to a pre-defined Properties file.
+ The result of parsing is a String value that corresponds to the command that is to be run. This String value will then be used to call the subsequent methods. 
+ Errors are detected by the Interpreter class as well as each package class (ex: Math, Boolean...). 
	+ Nonexistent commands will be detected by the Interpreter class  - syntax error
	+ Numerical/value/token errors will be detected by each package class.
+ Each method in a given class will run a pre-defined algorithm that carries out the function of its namesake.
+ A listener on the frontend side will wait for changes to the backend, and visualize changes accordingly.

### Create APIs

+ External
	+ Frontend: 
	+ Backend: Interpretation methods (ex: forward(), back())

+ Internal
	+ Frontend: 
	+ Backend: 

### Use Cases

```java
	public Grid repopulateGrid(){
		
	}
```
